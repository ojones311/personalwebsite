            <p>
                My name is Owen Jones and I'm a full-stack web developer based in Bushwick(Brooklyn,NY). The act of physically building something makes my head hurt. <br></br> Why build a table when you can build a website? Basically, I want to make something that people love to use and then one day they wake up and can't picture their life without it.
