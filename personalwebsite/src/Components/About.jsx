                My name is Owen Jones and I'm a full-stack web developer based in Bushwick (Brooklyn,NY). I love to snowboard, play soccer, solve puzzles, and cook. <br></br>There isn't anything that doesn't interest me if its interesting. <br></br>When its all said and done I want to have made something that people love to use. <br></br>I want someone to wake up one day and realize they can't picture their life without it. Knowing I had that kind of impact and ability to brighten someones day is why I type away.
