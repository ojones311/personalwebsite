                    I'm a full-stack web developer based in Bushwick (Brooklyn,NY). I love to snowboard, play soccer, solve puzzles, and cook. There isn't anything that doesn't interest me if it's interesting. My goal is to make something that people love to use, something they can't picture their life without. Knowing I had that kind of impact and ability to brighten someones day is why I type away.
